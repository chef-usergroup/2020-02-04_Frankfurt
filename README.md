# Chef Usergroup 2020-02-05

Welcome to our first Chef Usergroup Meetup in Germany.
We’ve prepared a pretty small agenda, which might give you an idea, what we want to do on this Tuesday:

* Introductions
* Tech-Talk: Delivering high quality cookbooks with test-kitchen
* Discussion and networking
* Searching for other hosts

…of course, we also have food and drinks for you ;)
